# Task 09: Comprehensive Error Handling

## Title
Implement robust error handling for all local model operations

## What needs to be done
Add comprehensive error handling throughout the local model system, including graceful failures, user-friendly error messages, and retry mechanisms for common failure scenarios.

## Requirements
- Handle Ollama installation failures with actionable prompts
- Manage network failures during model downloads with retry options
- Deal with insufficient system resources with clear error messages
- Handle model startup failures with recovery mechanisms
- Provide meaningful error messages for all failure scenarios
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Add error toasts and notifications using existing toast system
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

## Acceptance Criteria
- Installation failures show "Retry" or "Manual Install" options
- Network failures during download offer retry with progress restoration
- Insufficient resources show specific error (RAM/storage) with guidance
- Model startup failures display retry button in model selector
- All errors show user-friendly messages, not technical jargon
- Retry mechanisms work correctly for recoverable errors
- Error notifications integrate with existing toast system
- System remains stable even when errors occur

## Additional Details
- Use existing toast notification system for error display
- Distinguish between recoverable and non-recoverable errors
- Provide specific guidance for resource-related errors
- Consider adding help links for common issues
- Don't crash the application on local model errors
- Preserve user data and state during error conditions
