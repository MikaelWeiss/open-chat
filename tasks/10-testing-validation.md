# Task 10: Testing and Validation

## Title
Test the complete Local provider system and validate all functionality

## What needs to be done
Thoroughly test the entire Local provider implementation across different scenarios and system configurations to ensure everything works as expected and integrates properly with the existing application.

## Requirements
- Test Ollama detection on systems with and without Ollama installed
- Verify model discovery works correctly across different configurations
- Test model downloading and installation through the UI
- Validate model switching and lifecycle management
- Test error scenarios and recovery mechanisms
- Verify integration with existing chat functionality
- Test system resource validation and warnings
- Check UI responsiveness and error handling

## Acceptance Criteria
- All Ollama detection scenarios work correctly
- Model discovery finds existing models reliably
- Model downloads complete successfully with progress tracking
- Model switching works seamlessly between local and cloud providers
- Error handling provides appropriate feedback and recovery options
- UI remains responsive during long operations
- System resource warnings prevent obvious mismatches
- Integration doesn't break existing provider functionality

## Additional Details
- Test on multiple platforms if possible (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- Test with various model sizes and types
- Verify memory and storage management
- Check edge cases like network interruptions
- Ensure existing chat functionality remains intact
- Validate that cloud providers still work correctly
- Test with different Ollama configurations
