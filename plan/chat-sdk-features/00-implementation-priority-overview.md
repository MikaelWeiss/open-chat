## Resource Allocation Recommendations

### Immediate Focus (Weeks 1-6)
1. **Message Parts Architecture** (Weeks 1-3)
   - Critical foundation for all other features
   - Requires database migration planning
   - Should be implemented carefully with backward compatibility

2. **Generative UI/Artifacts** (Weeks 4-6)
   - High user impact feature
   - Builds directly on message parts
   - Major competitive differentiator

### Short-term Goals (Weeks 7-12)
3. **Tool Calling Integration** (Weeks 7-10)
   - Start with weather and calculator tools
   - Significant user value addition
   - Requires external API integration

4. **Advanced Model Management** (Weeks 10-12)
   - Improves AI quality and capabilities
   - Reasoning display adds transparency
   - Provider flexibility for future-proofing

5. **Stream Resumption** (Week 12)
   - Quick implementation with high reliability impact
   - Can be done in parallel with other features

### Long-term Enhancement (Weeks 13+)
6. **Enhanced Testing Framework** (Weeks 13-15)
   - Critical for maintainable codebase
   - Should be implemented before adding more features
   - Enables confident future development

7. **Advanced Theme System** (Weeks 16-18)
   - Polish feature for professional appearance
   - Can be implemented iteratively
   - Good for user retention and satisfaction

## Success Metrics by Phase

### Phase 1 Success Metrics
- Message parts migration completes successfully
- Users can create and interact with basic artifacts  
- No regression in core chat functionality
- Database performance remains acceptable

### Phase 2 Success Metrics
- Users actively engage with tools (weather, calculator)
- AI reasoning display improves user trust
- Stream interruptions don't lose user responses
- Advanced model routing improves response quality

### Phase 3 Success Metrics
- Test suite covers >80% of AI interaction scenarios
- Users customize themes and appearance
- Development velocity increases with better tooling
- App feels professional and polished

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### High-Risk Items
1. **Message Parts Migration**: Plan rollback strategy, extensive testing
2. **Database Changes**: Backup procedures, gradual migration approach
3. **External API Dependencies**: Fallback options, rate limiting, caching

### Development Approach
- **Incremental Implementation**: Each feature should be usable independently
- **Feature Flags**: Allow enabling/disabling features during development
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility during transitions
- **User Testing**: Get feedback early and often during development

## Conclusion

This roadmap prioritizes foundational features that enable advanced capabilities, followed by high-impact user experience improvements, and finally professional polish features. The total estimated timeline is 15-18 weeks for full implementation, but the app will have significant value improvements after each phase.

**Recommended Starting Point**: Begin with Message Parts Architecture as it unlocks the most value for subsequent features and represents the biggest architectural improvement over your current system.
