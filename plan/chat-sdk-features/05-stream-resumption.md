# Stream Resumption

## Overview
Chat SDK implements stream resumption capabilities that allow interrupted AI generation streams to be resumed from where they left off. This prevents loss of partial responses due to network issues, app crashes, or user navigation.

## What Your App Currently Lacks
- **Lost Responses**: Network interruptions cause complete loss of partial responses
- **No Recovery**: App crashes or navigation lose in-progress generations
- **Poor UX**: Users must restart conversations after interruptions
- **No Persistence**: Streaming state is not saved across app sessions

## Key Features from Chat SDK

### 1. Automatic Stream Recovery
- **Network Resilience**: Automatically resume after network interruptions
- **Session Persistence**: Resume streams across app restarts
- **Background Recovery**: Resume streams when returning to foreground
- **Smart Retry**: Intelligent retry logic with backoff strategies

### 2. Stream State Management
- **Persistent Storage**: Save stream state to database/storage
- **Progress Tracking**: Track how much of the response was received
- **Token Counting**: Maintain accurate token usage during resumption
- **Message Continuity**: Seamlessly continue message content

### 3. User Experience Features
- **Resume Indicators**: Show users when streams are being resumed
- **Manual Resume**: Allow users to manually trigger resume attempts
- **Progress Display**: Show resumption progress to users
- **Graceful Fallback**: Handle cases where resumption fails

### 4. React Hook Integration
- **useChat Hook**: Built-in `experimental_resume` function
- **Automatic Handling**: Hooks handle resumption automatically
- **State Management**: Proper state updates during resumption
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling for failed resumes

## Current vs Chat SDK Stream Handling

### Your Current Streaming
- Streams lost on interruption
- No recovery mechanism
- Manual restart required
- No state persistence

### Chat SDK Stream Resumption
```typescript
// Automatic resumption on component mount
const { experimental_resume } = useChat({ id: conversationId });

useEffect(() => {
  experimental_resume();
}, []); // Resume on component mount

// Manual resumption
const handleResume = async () => {
  try {
    await experimental_resume();
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle resumption failure
  }
};
```

## Stream Resumption Architecture

### 1. Stream State Persistence
- **Database Storage**: Save stream progress to SQLite
- **Message Tracking**: Track partial message content
- **Token Accounting**: Maintain accurate token counts
- **Timestamp Management**: Track when streams were interrupted

### 2. Resume Detection
- **App Launch**: Check for interrupted streams on startup
- **Component Mount**: Resume streams when chat components load
- **Network Restore**: Detect network restoration and resume
- **Focus Events**: Resume when app regains focus

### 3. Recovery Strategies
- **Immediate Retry**: Quick retry for temporary network issues
- **Exponential Backoff**: Progressive delay for persistent failures
- **Token Optimization**: Resume from last successful token
- **Fallback Options**: Alternative recovery methods

## Implementation Plan for Open Chat

### Phase 1: Stream State Tracking (High Priority)
1. **Database Schema**
   - Add `streaming_sessions` table for active streams
   - Track conversation ID, message ID, progress, and state
   - Store partial content and token counts
   - Add timestamps for interruption detection

2. **State Management**
   - Extend chat store to handle streaming state
   - Add stream persistence during generation
   - Implement stream cleanup on completion
   - Track partial message content

### Phase 2: Resume Infrastructure (High Priority)
1. **Resume Detection**
   - Check for interrupted streams on app startup
   - Detect interrupted streams in conversation components
   - Monitor network connectivity changes
   - Handle app focus/background events

2. **Resume Execution**
   - Implement stream resumption logic
   - Handle token position tracking
   - Merge resumed content with existing partial content
   - Update UI during resumption process

### Phase 3: User Experience (Medium Priority)
1. **Resume Indicators**
   - Show "resuming..." indicators in UI
   - Display resume progress when applicable
   - Add manual resume buttons for failed attempts
   - Show resume success/failure notifications

2. **Error Handling**
   - Handle resumption failures gracefully
   - Provide manual retry options
   - Clear invalid stream states
   - Fallback to fresh generation when needed

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Lower Priority)
1. **Smart Resumption**
   - Analyze interruption patterns
   - Optimize resumption timing
   - Implement predictive resumption
   - Add resumption analytics

## Technical Architecture

### Stream State Schema
```typescript
interface StreamingSession {
  id: string;
  conversationId: string;
  messageId: string;
  status: 'active' | 'interrupted' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  partialContent: string;
  tokenCount: number;
  lastActivity: Date;
  resumeAttempts: number;
  metadata: {
    model: string;
    provider: string;
    promptTokens: number;
  };
}
```

### Resume Logic Flow
1. **Detection**: Identify interrupted streams
2. **Validation**: Verify stream is resumable
3. **Preparation**: Prepare resume request with context
4. **Execution**: Send resume request to AI provider
5. **Merging**: Combine resumed content with existing
6. **Cleanup**: Clear streaming session on completion

## Technical Considerations

### Tauri-Specific Adaptations
- **SQLite Persistence**: Use SQLite for stream state storage
- **App Lifecycle**: Handle Tauri window focus/blur events
- **Background Processing**: Manage streams when app is backgrounded
- **File System**: Store stream state in app data directory

### Network Handling
- **Connection Monitoring**: Detect network availability changes
- **Retry Logic**: Implement smart retry with exponential backoff
- **Timeout Management**: Handle long-running resume attempts
- **Provider Differences**: Account for different AI provider behaviors

### Performance Considerations
- **Memory Usage**: Manage memory for stored partial content
- **Database Cleanup**: Remove old streaming sessions
- **Resume Throttling**: Prevent excessive resume attempts
- **Token Tracking**: Accurately track token usage across resumes

## Benefits for Your App
1. **Reliability**: Users don't lose AI responses to interruptions
2. **Better UX**: Seamless conversation continuity
3. **Professional Feel**: Robust handling of network issues
4. **User Trust**: Reliable service that works despite technical issues
5. **Reduced Frustration**: No need to restart interrupted conversations

## Effort Estimation
- **Medium Complexity**: Requires database changes and stream management
- **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks for core implementation
- **Dependencies**: Requires message handling improvements

## Success Metrics
- Reduction in lost/incomplete responses
- User retention after network interruptions
- Successful resume rate
- Time to recovery after interruptions

## Risk Assessment
- **Low-Medium**: Well-defined feature with clear implementation path
- **Provider Support**: Not all AI providers may support resumption
- **State Complexity**: Managing stream state adds complexity
- **Edge Cases**: Many edge cases to handle (corrupted state, etc.)

## Implementation Priority
**Medium Priority** - Valuable quality-of-life feature that significantly improves user experience. Should be implemented after core messaging features are stable. Provides professional polish and reliability that users expect from desktop applications.
