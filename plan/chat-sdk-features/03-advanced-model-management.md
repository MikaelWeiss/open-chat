# Advanced Model Management

## Overview
Chat SDK implements a sophisticated model management system that goes beyond simple provider switching. It supports specialized models for different tasks, reasoning models with structured thought processes, and advanced middleware for enhanced AI capabilities.

## What Your App Currently Lacks
- **Single Model Per Provider**: Your app only supports one model per AI provider
- **Basic Provider Switching**: Simple model selection without task-specific optimization
- **No Reasoning Display**: Missing AI thought process visibility
- **Limited Model Capabilities**: No specialized models for titles, artifacts, or images

## Key Features from Chat SDK

### 1. Multi-Model Provider Architecture
- **Task-Specific Models**: Different models for chat, reasoning, titles, artifacts
- **Model Specialization**: Optimize model choice for specific use cases
- **Image Model Support**: Separate models for image generation tasks
- **Model Middleware**: Enhance models with custom processing layers

### 2. Reasoning Models with Middleware
- **Structured Thinking**: Models wrapped with reasoning extraction middleware
- **Thought Process Display**: Show AI's internal reasoning before responses
- **Configurable Tags**: Extract reasoning from custom XML tags (`<think>`)
- **Transparency**: Users see how AI arrives at conclusions

### 3. Custom Provider System
- **Multi-Provider Setup**: Mix and match models from different providers
- **Provider Abstraction**: Unified interface across all AI providers
- **Model Routing**: Automatically route requests to optimal model
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful handling of model failures

### 4. Model Capabilities Tracking
- **Vision Support**: Track which models support image input
- **Tool Calling**: Identify models with function calling capabilities  
- **Context Limits**: Manage different context window sizes
- **Cost Optimization**: Route to cost-effective models when appropriate

## Current vs Chat SDK Model Architecture

### Your Current Provider System
```typescript
interface Provider {
  name: string;
  apiKey: string;
  baseUrl?: string;
  model: string;  // Single model per provider
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

### Chat SDK Provider System
```typescript
const myProvider = customProvider({
  languageModels: {
    "chat-model": anthropic("claude-3-5-sonnet"),
    "chat-model-reasoning": wrapLanguageModel({
      model: anthropic("claude-3-5-sonnet"),
      middleware: extractReasoningMiddleware({ tagName: "think" }),
    }),
    "title-model": openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
    "artifact-model": xai("grok-2-1212"),
  },
  imageModels: {
    "image-model": openai.image("dall-e-3"),
  },
});
```

## Implementation Plan for Open Chat

### Phase 1: Provider Architecture Redesign (High Priority)
1. **Multi-Model Support**
   - Extend provider schema to support multiple models per provider
   - Add model type categorization (chat, reasoning, title, artifact, image)
   - Update provider management UI to handle model selection
   - Implement model routing logic

2. **Database Schema Updates**
   - Add `model_configs` table for storing model configurations
   - Link providers to multiple model configurations
   - Add model capability tracking fields
   - Migrate existing single-model providers

### Phase 2: Reasoning Models (Medium Priority)
1. **Reasoning Middleware**
   - Implement reasoning extraction from AI responses
   - Add support for structured thinking display
   - Create collapsible reasoning sections in UI
   - Add reasoning model configuration options

2. **Model Wrapping System**
   - Create middleware system for model enhancement
   - Implement reasoning extraction middleware
   - Add custom prompt injection for reasoning
   - Support multiple middleware layers

### Phase 3: Advanced Model Features (Medium Priority)
1. **Task-Specific Routing**
   - Implement automatic model selection based on task type
   - Add conversation title generation with specialized models
   - Route artifact generation to appropriate models
   - Optimize model choice for cost and performance

2. **Model Capabilities**
   - Track and display model capabilities (vision, tools, context)
   - Implement fallback logic for unsupported features
   - Add model performance monitoring
   - Create model recommendation system

### Phase 4: Advanced Provider Management (Lower Priority)
1. **Provider Mixing**
   - Allow different providers for different model types
   - Implement cross-provider model combinations
   - Add provider health monitoring
   - Create load balancing between providers

## Technical Architecture

### Model Configuration System
```typescript
interface ModelConfig {
  id: string;
  providerId: string;
  modelType: 'chat' | 'reasoning' | 'title' | 'artifact' | 'image';
  modelName: string;
  capabilities: {
    vision: boolean;
    toolCalling: boolean;
    reasoning: boolean;
    streaming: boolean;
  };
  settings: {
    temperature?: number;
    maxTokens?: number;
    systemPrompt?: string;
  };
  middleware?: MiddlewareConfig[];
}
```

### Reasoning Middleware
```typescript
interface ReasoningMiddleware {
  extractThoughts: (response: string) => {
    reasoning: string;
    finalResponse: string;
  };
  injectPrompt: (originalPrompt: string) => string;
}
```

## Technical Considerations

### Tauri-Specific Adaptations
- **Provider Storage**: Securely store multiple API keys per provider
- **Model Caching**: Cache model responses for better performance
- **Cross-Platform**: Ensure model management UI works on all platforms

### Database Design
- **Flexible Schema**: Support varying model configurations
- **Migration Strategy**: Smoothly migrate from single to multi-model
- **Performance**: Optimize model selection queries

### UI/UX Design
- **Model Selection**: Intuitive interface for choosing models by task
- **Reasoning Display**: Collapsible, readable reasoning sections
- **Provider Management**: Clear overview of model capabilities

## Benefits for Your App
1. **Better AI Quality**: Use optimal models for specific tasks
2. **Cost Optimization**: Route to cheaper models when appropriate
3. **Enhanced Trust**: Show users AI reasoning process
4. **Professional Features**: Advanced model management capabilities
5. **Future-Proof**: Support new AI providers and models easily

## Effort Estimation
- **Medium-High Complexity**: Significant changes to provider system
- **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks for core implementation
- **Dependencies**: May need AI SDK library for advanced features

## Success Metrics
- Improved response quality for different task types
- User engagement with reasoning display
- Cost reduction through optimal model routing
- Reduced provider-related errors and failures

## Risk Assessment
- **Medium**: Major changes to existing provider system
- **Data Migration**: Risk of losing existing provider configurations
- **Complexity**: More complex provider management UI
- **API Costs**: Potential for increased costs with multiple models

## Implementation Priority
**Medium Priority** - While valuable, this builds on the message parts system and is less critical than foundational features. Implement after message parts architecture is stable.
