# Mobile Testing & Validation

## Overview
Establish comprehensive testing strategy for mobile functionality, ensuring the app works correctly across different iOS devices and scenarios.

## Current State
- Desktop-focused testing
- No mobile-specific test scenarios
- Limited device coverage testing

## Requirements

### 1. Device Testing Matrix
- Test on multiple iPhone models (iPhone SE, iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro Max)
- Validate across different iOS versions (iOS 15+)
- Test both portrait and landscape orientations
- Verify functionality on different screen densities

### 2. Mobile Interaction Testing
- Validate touch interactions and gesture recognition
- Test keyboard behavior and input handling
- Verify scroll performance and momentum
- Test long-press and swipe gestures

### 3. iOS Integration Testing
- Test safe area handling across all device types
- Validate iOS theme switching behavior
- Test accessibility features (VoiceOver, Dynamic Type)
- Verify proper iOS permission handling

### 4. Network Condition Testing
- Test on slow mobile networks (3G, poor WiFi)
- Validate offline behavior and error handling
- Test network switching scenarios
- Verify request timeout and retry logic

### 5. Performance Testing
- Memory usage testing during extended use
- Battery drain analysis
- App launch time measurement
- Scroll performance validation

## Testing Categories

- Memory usage stays within acceptable limits
- Network requests complete within reasonable time
- Animations maintain 60fps performance

## Testing Tools and Methods
- iOS Simulator testing for development
- Physical device testing for validation
- Accessibility Inspector for accessibility validation
- Performance profiling tools for optimization

## Success Criteria
- All features work correctly on target iPhone models
- Performance meets established benchmarks
- Accessibility features work as expected
- No critical bugs in mobile-specific functionality
