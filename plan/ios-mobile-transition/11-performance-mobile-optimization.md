# Performance & Mobile Optimization

## Overview
Optimize app performance for mobile devices with limited resources, slower networks, and battery constraints.

## Current State
- Desktop-optimized performance assumptions
- No mobile-specific optimizations
- Potential memory and battery inefficiencies

## Requirements

### 1. Memory Management
- Optimize component re-rendering for mobile
- Implement proper cleanup for mobile lifecycle
- Reduce memory footprint for conversation history
- Optimize image and asset loading

### 2. Network Optimization
- Implement proper loading states for slow mobile networks
- Add offline capability detection
- Optimize API request batching
- Implement request retry logic for mobile networks

### 3. Battery Efficiency
- Minimize background processing on mobile
- Optimize polling and real-time features
- Reduce unnecessary network requests
- Implement efficient scroll handling

### 4. Mobile Bundle Optimization
- Split desktop and mobile bundles
- Lazy load mobile-specific components
- Optimize mobile asset delivery
- Minimize JavaScript bundle size for mobile

### 5. iOS Performance Patterns
- Implement iOS-appropriate virtualization for long lists
- Optimize for iOS WebView performance
- Use iOS-efficient animation patterns
- Implement proper mobile caching strategies

## Files to Modify
- `vite.config.ts` - Mobile build optimizations
- `src/components/Chat/MessageList.tsx` - Virtualization
- `src/utils/performance.ts` - Mobile performance utilities
- `src/hooks/usePerformance.ts` - Performance monitoring

## Performance Targets
- App startup time under 2 seconds on mobile
- Smooth 60fps scrolling and animations
- Memory usage under 100MB for typical usage
- Minimal impact on device battery life

## Monitoring Requirements
- Implement mobile performance metrics
- Monitor mobile-specific error rates
- Track mobile user experience metrics
- Set up mobile performance alerts

## Success Criteria
- Smooth performance on older iOS devices
- Efficient memory and battery usage
- Fast loading times on slow networks
- No performance-related user complaints
