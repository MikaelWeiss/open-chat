# ADR-001: Electron Architecture Choice

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Deciders**: Core Team  

## Context

We needed to choose a desktop application framework for Open Chat that would provide:
- Cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- Rich UI capabilities for chat interfaces
- Access to system APIs for global shortcuts and file handling
- Ability to integrate with multiple AI provider APIs
- Fast development iteration

## Decision

We chose **Electron** as the desktop application framework.

## Rationale

### Considered Options

1. **Electron** (Web technologies in native wrapper)
2. **Tauri** (Rust + Web frontend)
3. **Flutter Desktop** (Dart + native compilation)
4. **Native Development** (Swift/Objective-C for macOS, C++/C# for Windows, C++/GTK for Linux)

### Why Electron Won

**Pros:**
- **Team Expertise**: Team has strong JavaScript/TypeScript/React experience
- **Rapid Development**: Web technologies enable fast iteration and prototyping
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Access to npm ecosystem for AI SDKs, UI libraries, etc.
- **Cross-platform**: Single codebase for all platforms
- **Mature Tooling**: Established build tools, debugging, and deployment
- **System Integration**: Good APIs for global shortcuts, file system, native menus

**Cons We Accepted:**
- **Bundle Size**: Larger app size (~150MB vs ~20MB for native)
- **Memory Usage**: Higher baseline memory usage (~100MB vs ~30MB)
- **Performance**: Potentially slower than native for computation-heavy tasks

### Rejected Alternatives

**Tauri**:
- Pros: Smaller bundle size, better performance, security by default
- Cons: Team lacks Rust experience, newer ecosystem, fewer learning resources
- **Rejection Reason**: Learning curve too steep for rapid development

**Flutter Desktop**:
- Pros: Good performance, single codebase, growing ecosystem
- Cons: Team lacks Dart experience, desktop support still maturing
- **Rejection Reason**: Uncertainty about long-term desktop support

**Native Development**:
- Pros: Best performance, platform-native UX, smallest bundle size
- Cons: 3x development effort, different codebases per platform, complex AI SDK integration
- **Rejection Reason**: Resource constraints and time-to-market requirements

## Consequences

### Positive
- Fast development cycles with hot reloading
- Rich UI possibilities with React ecosystem
- Easy integration with AI provider REST APIs
- Single team can handle full-stack development
- Established debugging and deployment workflows

### Negative
- Users will need to accept larger download size
- Higher memory usage compared to native alternatives
- Potential performance bottlenecks for real-time features

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use esbuild for fast, optimized bundling
- Implement lazy loading for non-essential components
- Monitor bundle size and memory usage in CI
- Consider migrating performance-critical parts to native modules if needed

## Implementation Notes

### Security Configuration
- Enable context isolation and sandbox mode
- Disable node integration in renderer processes
- Use preload scripts for controlled API exposure

### Architecture Pattern
- Separate main process (Node.js) and renderer processes (React)
- Use IPC for secure communication between processes
- Service-oriented architecture in main process

### Performance Optimizations
- Tree-shaking with esbuild
- Code splitting for different windows (main vs quick chat)
- Efficient state management with Zustand

## Review Date
This decision should be reviewed in 12 months (January 2025) or if:
- Performance becomes a significant user complaint
- Team composition changes significantly
- Electron ecosystem shows major instability
