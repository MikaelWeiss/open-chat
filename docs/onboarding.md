## What is Open Chat?
Open Chat is a modern, feature-rich chat application for AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) that provides essential features missing from standard web interfaces - built with Electron and React.

## Quick Demo

## Getting Started (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or higher
- pnpm (recommended) or npm

### One-Line Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/open-chat.git && cd open-chat && pnpm install && pnpm rebuild electron && pnpm start
```

### Step-by-Step Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/open-chat.git
cd open-chat

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Rebuild Electron (if needed)
pnpm rebuild electron

# Start the application
pnpm start
```

### Development Commands
```bash
# Development mode with hot reload
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Package the app
pnpm build:app

# Quick start (assumes already built)
pnpm start:quick
```

### Opening the Debugger
1. Start in development mode: `pnpm dev`
2. Open DevTools:
   - **Main Window**: `Cmd+Option+I` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux)
   - **Quick Chat Window**: Same shortcuts when focused
3. For Electron main process debugging:
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=development electron --inspect=9229 .
   ```
   Then open `chrome://inspect` in Chrome and connect to the remote target.
