# Open Chat

> A modern, feature-rich chat application for AI providers with all the bells and whistles

## Why Open Chat?

Many AI provider chat interfaces (specifically Anthropic) lack essential features that power users need. Open Chat was created to provide a superior chat experience.

## Quick Start

Get up and running in one command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/open-chat.git && cd open-chat && pnpm install && pnpm rebuild electron && pnpm start
```

This will:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install all dependencies 
3. Run the app

## Installation & Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or higher
- pnpm (recommended) or npm

### Manual Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/open-chat.git
cd open-chat

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development mode
pnpm dev
```

### Available Scripts

- `pnpm dev` - Start development server with hot reload (React + Electron)
- `pnpm build` - Build the React app for production
- `pnpm build:app` - Build and package the app with Electron Builder
- `pnpm start` - Build and run in production mode

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please submit issues and pull requests!
