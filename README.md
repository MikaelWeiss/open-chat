## Why Open Chat?

When building Open Chat, there was a clear problem: many existing AI chat applications are frustrating to use, expensive to subscribe to, and don't guarantee your privacy. The goal was to create something better - an app that's simple, user-friendly, and powerful enough to take you as far as you want to go.

Why the name Open Chat? It's straightforward and represents our commitment to transparency. Help us make this app popular enough to get added to Homebrew!

## Features

- **Multi-Provider Support** - Connect to Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama, and custom endpoints
- **Secure API Key Management** - Keys stored in system keychain, never in files
- **Persistent Conversations** - SQLite database for chat history
- **Cross-Platform** - Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux) and mobile (iOS, Android)
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Quick access to common actions
- **Modern UI** - Dark/light themes with responsive design
- **Model Capabilities** - Automatic detection of vision, audio, and file support
- **Conversation Management** - Organize and search your chat history

## Database Schema

Open Chat uses SQLite for persistent storage:

- **conversations** - Chat sessions with metadata
- **messages** - Individual messages with role and content
- **providers** - AI provider configurations

Settings are stored in a separate key-value store (`settings.json`), and API keys are secured in the system keychain.

## Security

- API keys stored in system keychain (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service)
- No sensitive data stored in configuration files
- Database uses foreign key constraints for data integrity
- Secure inter-process communication between frontend and Tauri backend
